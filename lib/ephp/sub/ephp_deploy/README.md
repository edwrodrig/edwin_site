# ephp_deploy
Deploy utilities for PHP

## How to include this library in my code
Run the following command to download the code
```sh
php -d allow_url_include=On -r "require('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edwrodrig/ephp_deploy/master/scripts/lib.php');"
```
You will see a `ephp_deploy` folder with a `include.php` file. Just include that file in your project.
```php
require('path/to/ephp_deploy/include.php');
